            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Howdy! My name is Caroline Mejia and I am a senior Computer Engineering major at Texas A&M University. I
                have completed a minor in Mathematics and I hope to complete a minor in Cybersecurity. At Texas A&M
                University, I am a member of the Society of Women in Engineering and the Society of Hispanic
                Professional Engineers. In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games such as Valorant, Portal,
                Minecraft, and I especially love playing any Legend of Zelda game (Majora's Mask is currently my
                favorite game in the series). When I am not investing my time in video games, I like to take road trips
                and explore different restaurants along the way. I would say that I could be a foodie, however, I would
                not consider myself to be a food expert; if you ever need a restaurant recommendation I can provide
                that! I have found that through food, you are able to truly uncover what makes culture so great. I pride
                myself on exploring new cuisine, however, the cuisine of my own heritage will always be my favorite. I
                am Latina through my mother and father, although I do have Puerto Rican influences from my
                step-grandfather. My mother is Mexican; she was born and raised in a small town named Santiago de
                Ixcuintla and she eventually moved to the US when she married my father. My dad is Ecuadorean and he was
                born in Manta, Ecuador. At the young age of 7, my dad moved to Brooklyn, New York, and has lived in the
                US ever since. Although it might not be very common, I am very proud to be a Latina woman pursuing a
                degree in the STEM field. My dad, being an electrical engineer, inspired me to want to go into the
                engineering field. Now here I am 1 year away from obtaining a Bachelor's Degree. I am excited to see
                what the future holds and I hope you will join me on my journey! </p>

            <h4>Qualifications</h4>
            <p>My technical skills include knowledge in C++, object-oriented coding, javascript, html, autodesk
                inventor, SOLIDWorks, Verilog, and others.</p>
            <p>My technical areas of interest within the scope of computer science are cybersecurity, artificial
                intelligence, and machine learning. I picked these particular interest since they are all related to
                classes that I have taken at A&M and I found the content to be interesting. I also find these areas of
                interest to be incredibly valuable to the future of technology. </p>

            <p>Over the years, I have tried to give back to the Austin community by volunteering in the Feed My
                People Breakfeast program. Through the First United Methodist Church of Austin, a group of volunteers
                prepare and serve breakfeast for the homeless. I began volunteering with this organization when I was in
                middle
                school, so any age group can volunteer to serve breakfeat (if you are a minor than an adult is required
                to accompany you). To learn more information about this foundation, click the link
                below. </p>

            </p>
            <p>I love the city of Austin and one of the reasons the city is so beautiful is because of the many parks
                that are across the city. If you are interested in finding out how to help out the city of Austin,
